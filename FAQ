1. Why can't I get the source code for SASSI?

   SASSI is cooked into the production backend compiler, which is not
   open source, and probably never will be.  If you really want to see
   the code, please come work for NVIDIA.

2. Why is my instrumented program generating "illegal memory access"
   errors?

   We have seen this for a number of reasons, including:

   1. Your driver version is not at least 346.41.  You can test your
      driver version with the "nvidia-smi" command.

   2. You built your instrumentation libraries on one platform, but
      are trying to link them in on another platform.  I have
      encountered this when I built my libraries an old version of
      CentOS, but accidentally linked them in on a newer Debian
      platform.

   3. You're using an old version of CUPTI.  If you're going to use
      CUPTI, you should use the CUDA 7 version.

3. Why doesn't the SASSI version of ptxas generate exactly the same
   code as the version distributed in the official toolkit?

   The backend compiler in which SASSI is embedded is based on a fork
   of the production compiler, and thus in some cases, code generation
   may differ from that of the official ptxas.  But in all cases, the
   performance of the generated code should be highly competitive.

4. Why am I seeing a bunch of CUPTI-related link errors?

   Link order is very important with nvcc, with library functions only 
   being linked in "as-needed".  Therefore, if your instrumentation 
   library depends on CUPTI, make sure to link in CUPTI *after* your
   library.
